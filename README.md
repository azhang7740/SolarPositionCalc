# SolarPositionCalc
A MATLAB implementation of the solar position algorithms from Jean Meeus's Astronomical Algorithms book and the NOAA Solar Position Calculator. 

This solar position calculator determines the azimuth and elevation angles of the sun given latitude, longitude, time, date, and time zone variables. All calculations
in the program are implemented from the two sources below.
